## About
Calculator is a single-page web application designed for performing basic arithmetic operations. It features a clean and responsive interface with a dark/light theme toggle, a readonly display for calculations, and a date display in the header. The project uses vanilla JavaScript for functionality, custom CSS for styling, and the PTSans font (loaded as Vazirmatn) for a modern look.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and percentage (%).
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., multiple decimals, consecutive operators) and displays results accurately.
- **Clear and Delete**: "AC" button resets the calculator, and "DEL" removes the last character.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes, with preferences saved in local storage.
- **Date Display**: Shows the current date in the header.
- **Responsive Design**: Fixed 300px width, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons have hover and click animations with shadows and scaling effects.
- **Favicon**: Custom favicon (`fav-icon.png`) for browser tab branding.

## Installation
To run the Calculator application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ImRez69/Calculator.git
   cd Calculator


Ensure the font and favicon files are included:The project uses the Vazirmatn.ttf font (as PTSans) in the Source/Font directory and a favicon (fav-icon.png) in the Source/Img directory. If these files are missing, replace the font reference in style.css with a fallback font like Arial or download the Vazirmatn font, and ensure the favicon is present.

Open the application:  

Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).  
No additional dependencies or build steps are required, as the project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Optionally, you can view a live demo (add link here, e.g., via GitHub Pages or htmlpreview.github.io).
